These tiny diamonds, which are formed under extreme pressure, are typically found in meteorites and comets. Hancock argues that the presence of these nanodiamonds in North America is strong evidence of a comet or asteroid impact, and that this impact was responsible for the destruction of the Clovis culture and the end of the last ice age.',
