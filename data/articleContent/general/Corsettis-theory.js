				text: 'The theory of an ancient apocalypse caused by a comet or asteroid impact is a widely debated topic among experts in the fields of archaeology and geology. Jimmy Corsetti, a researcher and author, has put forth a compelling argument for the occurrence of such an event in the distant past, based on a thorough examination of available evidence.',

				link: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium',
				text: 'One of the key pieces of evidence cited by Corsetti in support of his theory of an ancient apocalypse is the presence of a layer of iridium in the Earths crust. Iridium is a rare element that is found in relatively high concentrations in comets and asteroids, but is relatively rare on Earth. The discovery of a layer of iridium in the Earths crust is therefore considered to be strong evidence for an impact event.',

This event would have had devastating consequences for the Earths climate and environment, wiping out much of the planets life and altering the course of human history.',
