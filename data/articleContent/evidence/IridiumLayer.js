According to Hancock, this layer of sediment containing high levels of iridium is a telltale sign of a massive impact event that occurred around 12,000 years ago, causing widespread destruction and the near-extinction of mankind.',

The presence of this layer, known as the "iridium layer," has been found at sites around the world, including in Africa, Asia, and North and South America, providing strong evidence for the ancient apocalypse theory.',
