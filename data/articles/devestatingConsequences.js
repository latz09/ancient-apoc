The event is believed to have been caused by a massive asteroid impact, which created an iridium layer around the Earth. This layer is a telltale sign of a catastrophic event, as iridium is a rare element on Earth, but is commonly found in asteroids and comets.',

The explosion would have created a massive amount of dust and debris, which would have blocked out sunlight and caused a dramatic drop in temperature. This would have resulted in a "nuclear winter" effect, where the Earths surface would have been covered in a layer of ice and snow.',

It also highlights the importance of understanding and studying the potential dangers that threaten our planet, such as asteroid impacts, in order to protect the Earth and its inhabitants from future catastrophe.',
