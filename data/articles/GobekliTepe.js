				text: 'According to the theory proposed by British author Graham Hancock, Gobekli Tepe is evidence of a single, massive impact event that occurred around 10,800 BC. This event, which he calls the "Gobekli Tepe Impact Event," was responsible for the collapse of ancient civilizations such as the Clovis culture in North America and the end of the last ice age.',

				text: 'The ancient site of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey is one of the oldest known temple structures in the world, and its advanced architecture and intricate carvings have puzzled researchers for years. However, recent discoveries at the site have provided new evidence to support Hancocks theory. Researchers have uncovered evidence of an advanced civilization that existed before the collapse caused by this catastrophic event.',

				text: 'The excavations at Gobekli Tepe have revealed a complex network of stone circles and pillars, some of which are decorated with intricate carvings of animals and symbols. Radiocarbon dating has placed the construction of these structures at around 10,800 BC, which coincides with the proposed date of the impact event. This suggests that an advanced civilization existed before the collapse caused by this event.',

				text: 'Critics argue that there is not enough evidence to support the idea of a single, massive impact event. They argue that the collapse of ancient civilizations and the end of the last ice age is more likely to have been caused by a combination of factors, such as climate change and human conflict. However, the recent discoveries at Gobekli Tepe have provided new evidence to support Hancocks theory and have sparked renewed interest in the possibility of a massive impact event in human history.',
